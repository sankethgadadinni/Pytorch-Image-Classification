# Pytorch-Image-Classification

This repository consists of pytorch code for image classification.
The dataset used in this case is cactus dataset.

1) The Cactus dataset can be downloaded from this link.

    https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/data

1) Inorder to train the CNN network run the train.py file.

    python train.py

2) If you want to change the dataset change the base directory and path in the train.py

    base_dir = " "

    path = " "

3) If you want to evaluate the model run evaluate.py by changing the model path.
    
    model_path = " "

4) The predicted outputs are saved in submission.csv
